# clerk [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikepb/clerk.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mikepb/clerk)

CouchDB library for node and the browser and sister project to [sage][sage]

```javascript
var clerk = require('clerk');

var client = clerk('http://127.0.0.1:5984');

var db = client.db('test');

db.info(function(err, info) {
  console.dir(err || info);
});
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install clerk
```

## Experimental Browser Support

`clerk.js` and `clerk.min.js` are the browser and minified browser versions of
the library. Modern browsers are generally supported, but not widely tested.
The `test/index.html` and `test/index-min.html` run the [mocha][mocha] tests
in the browser.

Security restrictions on cross-domain requests currently limits the usefulness
of the browser version. Using a local proxy or configuring [Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing][cors] on a proxy in front of CouchDB may allow you to use
the library in the browser.

## Philosophy

The philosophy of *clerk* is to provide a thin wrapper around the CouchDB API,
making the database easier to use from JavaScript. *clerk* is designed to
quickly allow you to get started with CouchDB. As you get more comfortable
with *clerk* and CouchDB, *clerk* gives you full access to CouchDB's
more advanced features.

The library API generally follows the RESTful API, so you can use the CouchDB
docs as well as the *clerk* docs to build your applications. If a feature is
missing from *clerk* or you need to access more advanced features, the
`request` method allows you to send custom requests directly to CouchDB.
